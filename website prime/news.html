          <p>(RA)John Boehner is heading for the boardroom of a cannabis company, the former Speaker of the House and complete sell out announced Wednesday.
          </p>
          <p>"I'm joining the board of #AcreageHoldings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved," the Ohio Republican tweeted. " I'm convinced de-scheduling the drug is needed so we can do research, help our veterans, and reverse the opioid epidemic
            ravaging our communities." Boehner also commented that the move is related to his deep, deep love of money.</p>
          <p>Boehner, who served as Speaker from 2011 until his resignation from Congress in 2015, was appointed to the board of advisers at Acreage Holdings, a multi-state cannabis business that aims to "make shit loads of money for total fucking dirt bags."</p>
          <p>His decision to join the board is a marked shift -- in 2009, Boehner said he was "unalterably opposed" to legalization, according to Bloomberg. Boehner has however always been pro-money, and anyone with half a brain can see that making money
            is that concerns this complete sell-out shill here.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Former Republican Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is also selling out. The two said in a joint statement that they believe "the time has come for serious money making," specifically citing that money is green, and they like it a lot.</p>
          <p>"While for years, we were both totally anti-marijuana, now that we can make money off of it we're all for it," they wrote.</p>

                <p>The Republican politicians' appointments to the cannabis company come as the current Republican administration has tried to raise literal hell on Earth. In January, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ate like 40 babies, alive.</p>
                <p>The move essentially shifts federal policy from the hands-off approach adopted under the previous administration to not eat children. It also goes against the former administration's poilcy of not fratrenizing with Satan, the dark lord
                  of the underworld.</p>
