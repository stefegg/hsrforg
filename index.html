    <div class="col-1"><img src=/images/one.jpg><h2>You're Going to Die</h2>Did you know that human suffering is the leading cause of death today? By donating to our foundation, you are making the choice to not die. And if you're not dead, then aren't you alive?</div>
    <div class="col-2"><img src=/images/two.jpg><h2>Human Suffering is Scary</h2>Do you see how scared this man is? He's not even suffering yet, he's just thinking about it. And it's enough to make him want to eat his fingers. Don't eat your fingers, sell them for US dollars and then give that money to us.</div>
    <div class="col-3"><img src=/images/three.jpg><h2>This Man Looks Very Happy</h2>He's happy because he is not suffering. He has given us all of his money, and now lives in a mud hutt somewhere on Endor where he is very happy. You want to be happy, don't you?</div>
    <div class="col-4"><img src=/images/four.jpg><h2>The Angel of Death is Coming</h2>Bad news - if you don't give us all of your money, you're going to die. That's right, the angel of death works for us and we told him where you live. Give us all your money or he's coming for you.</div>
