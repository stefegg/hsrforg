<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="r2prime">
  <p id="r5">I used to be a property manager by trade. It had it's challenges, but was not very fulfilling. Problems were rarely solved permanently, and the clients were terrible.</p>
  <p id="r5">I decided late in 2016 that I wanted a change. But I didn't think there was much hope, time and money were both in short supply.So I saved, and saved, and saved. And when 2017 was finished, so was I as a property manager. I quit!</p>
  <p id="r5">But I still didn't know what I wanted to do yet - however a chance meeting with an old friend reminded me how much I used to love making websites as a kid. I'd always wanted to take a class or a boot camp... but again, time and money were always missing...
    until now!</p>
  <p id="r5">So I'm taking to test the waters - I'm loving it so far! It's really invigorating to be studying something i'm passionate about, and I'm loving devouring all the material.</p>
</div>
<div class="about">I also really like to travel! Most recently I visited Monterey, California. The photo on the main page was taken when I visited New Orleans for Voodoo Fest in 2016.</div>
<div class="life">I live in Brooklyn with my girlfriend and my cat.</div>
